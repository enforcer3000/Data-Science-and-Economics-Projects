# DSE project - Economic Growth
Our analysis uses a data set which comes from the Sala-i-Martin et al. (2004) paper published in American Economic Review which contains 139 observations and 71 variables. We aim to identify the factors most strongly associated with long-term economic growth and evaluate how well different modelling approaches capture these relationships.
